# AutoHotKey_Scripts
Learning AutoHotKey and will continue to be adding scripts as I learn.

AutoHotKey is a program that automates Windows tasks, similar to programming macros in VBA.
While useful, it CAN mess up your computer if your macros are not coded correctly.
For example, I did not put a # in {}s and it ended up deleting the wireless networking driver from my computer.

High rewards, but high risk.
