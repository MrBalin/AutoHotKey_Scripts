# AutoHotKey_Scripts
Learning AutoHotKey and will continue to be adding scripts as I learn.

AutoHotKey is a program that automates Windows tasks, similar to programming macros in VBA.
While useful, it CAN mess up your computer if your macros are not coded correctly.
For example, I did not put a # in {}s and it ended up deleting the wireless networking driver from my computer.
High rewards, but high risk.

Sublime text is good IDE for AHK(AutoHotKey) and while it's pretty much Notepad all glamoured up, it does offer Intellisense with a badjillion languages, including AHK, once downloaded. *Sorry, I forgot how I did it.
